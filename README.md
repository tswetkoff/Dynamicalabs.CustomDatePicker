# Dynamicalabs.CustomDatePicker
A PCF control that allows the user to pick a date without a day or year (Year-Month or Month/Day). A control can be enabled on the text field. \
The selected value is stored in the text field and the user has an ability to sort by this field on the view.  
Picklist styles are similar to OOB.
